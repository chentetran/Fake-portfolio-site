This website is for project 1 in Comp20: Web Programming.
It is supposed to contain a biography and resume of myself, although
I substituted my biography with fiction based in the Star Wars Universe.
I genuinely hope that I do not come off as an uber nerd.

I successfully added text and image content with HTML.
I also successfully styled the DOM with CSS, adding scrollable text
boxes, backgrounds, colors, and fonts.

I consulted threads on stackexchange.com and w3school for brief introductions
to certain HTML elements and CSS stylings.

I spent approximately 6 hours on this assignment.
